# deviceMonitor
<h3>It's a beginning project using Python Library (<strong>OpenCV</strong>) to host the live video feed onto the network through the Port 5000.</h3>
<p>Tools used</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenCV and Harcascade pre-trained model for facial recognition</li>
<li>Flask</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to run this?</h4>
<p>Clone the repository in your current system (your system should have webcam on it) </p>
<p>The next step is to run the <strong>streamer.py<br/><img src="https://github.com/hprabesh/deviceMonitor/blob/master/img1.jpg" alt="Run Streamer.py"/></strong>
<br/>This will open the port on <strong>5000</strong> and you can run the program on your browser in the url:<br/>http://|your-gatewayaddress (E.g:104.103.22.1)|/home</p>

<p>Application:
<br>1. Monitor your child/ elderly person while you are at work
and many more...
</p>

<p>Hope you like it :')</p>

<p>Note: You need to edit the camera.py file to change the harcascade library<br/><img src="https://github.com/hprabesh/deviceMonitor/blob/master/2.png" alt="Change Harcascade Location"/></p>
